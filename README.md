# What is jlite?

Jlite is a personal project in which I develop a simple scripting language called jlite.
I intend on making two version of the interpreter, one in Java and the other in C++.

The reason behind this is a personal interest in the area of Compilers and Interpreters.

As references, I use Crafting Interpreters and the Dragon Book.

The language is basically the same as lox (from Crafting Interpreters). With some modifications made by myself.
